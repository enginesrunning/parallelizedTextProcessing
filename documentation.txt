1. File Reading (Process 0 only)
The root process (rank == 0) opens and reads the entire input file into memory.

It gets the file size, reads the file content into a buffer (file_content).

2. Broadcasting File Size
The root broadcasts the file size to all other MPI processes with MPI_Bcast.

Every process now knows how big the file is.

3. Chunk Distribution (Scatterv)
The file is split into roughly equal chunks — sendcounts[] holds the size of each chunk for each process, displs[] the offset.

MPI_Scatterv sends each process its assigned chunk of text from the root's buffer.

Each process receives only its chunk, not the entire file.

4. Handling Word Boundaries Between Chunks
Since chunks can split words across boundaries, the code has a mechanism to communicate whether a chunk ends inside a word or not.

Each process:

Receives from the previous rank whether the previous chunk ended inside a word (prev_ends_in_word).

Uses this to decide if the start of its chunk continues a word (so it won’t count that partial word as a new word).

After processing, it determines if its chunk ends inside a word (current_ends_in_word).

Sends this flag to the next process, so the chain continues.

This handshake ensures no double counting of words split between chunks.

5. Local Chunk Processing
Each process independently processes its chunk:

Counts lines (\n characters),

Counts words (based on transitions from non-alphanumeric to alphanumeric, 
adjusted by prev_ends_in_word),

Counts characters,

Counts vowels.

6. Reduction to Root
After all processes finish their local counts, MPI_Reduce collects 
and sums the results on the root process.

The root process then prints the total counts.

Summary

Root reads file	Reads whole file into memory
Broadcast file size	All processes know file size
Scatter chunks	Each process gets a chunk of the file
Communicate boundaries	Each process gets flag from previous, sends to next
Process chunks locally	Counts lines, words, vowels, chars for chunk
Reduce results	Root sums all partial results
Output results	Root prints the final statistics
